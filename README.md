# Binge Watching App

## Problem
Track all the videos watched/not watched in a YouTube channel (series guide for YouTube).

## Features
-  Connect to my YouTube account.
-  Add channels.
-  Sync like / unlike reactions.
-  Consider like/unlike as watched (bidirectional?).

## Proposal
Implement the same web app in multiple stacks:
-  **Meteor + React + MongoDB** - Filipe's choice
-  **Next.js App router + PostgreSQL** - Francisko's choice
-  **Nest.js + Vue.js** - Robert's Choice
-  **Ruby on Rails + SQLite** - Jo√£o's choice
-  **Go + HTMX? + MySQL** - Isaque's choice

### Why?
-  Understand differences.
-  Make informed choices.
-  Learn tradeoffs.
-  Learn how to argue in favor of a solution.
